Yes: all three still look like **real gaps**, but only if you position them as **end-to-end, reusable, NYC-specific tools** rather than generic wrappers around existing libraries. The pattern I found is that there are plenty of **building blocks** and a handful of **one-off research repos**, but I did **not** find a clearly popular, maintained, `pip install`-style package that already delivers the exact product shape you described for any of the three ideas [cjio README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityjson/cjio/develop/README.rst) [CityTiler README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeremy-Gaillard/CityTiler/master/README.md) [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md) [smart-311 README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hersh-gupta/smart-311/main/README.md) [nyc-311-analytics README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajatrayaraddi/nyc-311-analytics/main/README.md).

## `nyc-mesh`

This one looks like the **cleanest gap** of the three. I found tools for adjacent formats and conversions, but not a popular NYC-focused toolkit that takes NYC open 3D data from raw inputs to lightweight web-ready outputs in the way your spec describes [cjio README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityjson/cjio/develop/README.rst) [CityTiler README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeremy-Gaillard/CityTiler/master/README.md) [PyPI search results for CityGML/3D Tiles packages](https://pypi.org/project/cjio/).

The main incumbents are:
- `cjio`, which is a Python CLI/API for **CityJSON**, not an NYC-specific CityGML + LiDAR preparation pipeline; it supports things like reprojection, subset selection, validation, and glTF export, but it is format tooling rather than “download NYC data and produce deployable neighborhood outputs” product tooling [cjio README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityjson/cjio/develop/README.rst).
- `py3dtiles`, which is a Python library for working with **3D Tiles**, especially point clouds, but again it is a low-level format library rather than an NYC-specific data-prep toolkit [py3dtiles README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oslandia/py3dtiles/master/README.rst).
- `CityTiler`, which converts CityGML to 3D Tiles, but its own README says it focuses on **untextured LoD2 buildings** and requires a heavier stack including **3DCityDB, PostgreSQL, and PostGIS**; that is much more infrastructure-heavy than your “shallow dependency, pip-installable, web-ready outputs” positioning [CityTiler README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeremy-Gaillard/CityTiler/master/README.md).

So the gap is **not** “nobody can parse CityGML.” The gap is: there does not appear to be a well-known package that is simultaneously **NYC-specific, Python-first, lightweight, and optimized for web-consumable outputs from NYC’s raw CityGML/LiDAR sources** [cjio README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityjson/cjio/develop/README.rst) [CityTiler README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeremy-Gaillard/CityTiler/master/README.md) [Web search: NYC CityGML LiDAR tools](https://github.com/Jeremy-Gaillard/CityTiler).

The right differentiation line for `nyc-mesh` is:
- not “another 3D GIS library”
- but “the easiest way to go from NYC open 3D source files to browser-friendly neighborhood meshes and analysis-ready exports” [cjio README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityjson/cjio/develop/README.rst) [py3dtiles README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oslandia/py3dtiles/master/README.rst)

## `subway-access`

This is also a real gap, but it is the **most likely to overlap with prior civic-tech work**, so you need to position it carefully. There are existing repos and datasets around MTA accessibility, but I did not find a clearly dominant, actively maintained library that packages the full “ADA status + outage reliability + catchments + equity scoring” workflow as a reusable product [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md) [MTA elevator/accessibility developer docs](https://mta.info/developers/display-elevators-NYCT) [Web search: MTA accessibility analysis tools](https://github.com/TangoYankee/subway-ada-sdss).

The closest incumbent is `tsdataclinic/mta`. It is strong and relevant, but the README explicitly says the project is **no longer maintained by Two Sigma**, and what it ships are mainly **data products, graph pipelines, turnstile processing, and crosswalks**, not a polished, public package with a simple analyst-facing API and reproducible scoring workflow [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md). That is actually good news for you: it means there is prior art, but not a locked-up winner [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md).

Other adjacent projects exist, but they are narrower:
- `MTA-GTFS-ADA-Subway-Stations` is basically an augmented GTFS `stops.txt` with ADA columns, not a full analyzer [MTA-GTFS-ADA-Subway-Stations README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newyorkhack/MTA-GTFS-ADA-Subway-Stations/master/README.md).
- `nyc-subway-time` is a CLI for arrivals, service info, and ADA access, not a planning/equity analysis toolkit [nyc-subway-time README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/otherfutures/nyc-subway-time/main/README.md).
- The MTA itself provides the raw ingredients: canonical station accessibility data plus live equipment and outage feeds, but not the kind of composite reliability/equity analysis you’re proposing [MTA elevator/accessibility developer docs](https://mta.info/developers/display-elevators-NYCT).

So the gap here is **not** “nobody has touched subway accessibility.” The gap is: there is no obvious popular OSS library that turns those official feeds plus street-network analysis plus demographics into a **repeatable accessibility scoring and gap-analysis toolkit** [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md) [MTA elevator/accessibility developer docs](https://mta.info/developers/display-elevators-NYCT).

The right differentiation line for `subway-access` is:
- not “we have ADA station data”
- but “we measure how accessible the system is in practice, over time, for actual neighborhoods” [MTA elevator/accessibility developer docs](https://mta.info/developers/display-elevators-NYCT) [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md)

## `nyc311`

This also looks like a genuine gap, and the evidence is pretty consistent: there are lots of **analysis notebooks** and some **LLM-ish demos**, but I did not find a popular reusable package that packages NYC 311 topic extraction, anomaly detection, and resolution-gap analysis into a stable library/CLI [smart-311 README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hersh-gupta/smart-311/main/README.md) [nyc-311-analytics README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajatrayaraddi/nyc-311-analytics/main/README.md) [PyPI search: Socrata + 311 packages](https://pypi.org/project/sodapy/).

The strongest “not actually your competitor” result is `smart-311`. It is about improving **municipal 311 request processing at intake time** using multimodal models, which is a different problem from mining the historical NYC 311 corpus for topics, trends, and neighborhood anomalies [smart-311 README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hersh-gupta/smart-311/main/README.md).

The closest adjacent analysis repo is `nyc-311-analytics`, which is interesting and recent, but it is framed as a **notebook-based analysis project** with `main.ipynb`, anomaly notebooks, data reduction notebooks, and a draft paper, not a reusable package with a clean API/CLI and documented reproducible outputs [nyc-311-analytics README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajatrayaraddi/nyc-311-analytics/main/README.md).

On the package side, I found tools for **getting Socrata data** such as `sodapy` and `socrata-py`, but the search did **not** surface a PyPI package with built-in NYC 311 topic modeling or anomaly detection [PyPI search: Socrata + 311 packages](https://pypi.org/project/sodapy/). That suggests the ecosystem has ingestion clients and one-off studies, but not your proposed product [PyPI search: Socrata + 311 packages](https://pypi.org/project/sodapy/).

So the gap here is **not** “nobody analyzes 311.” The gap is: there does not seem to be a recognized OSS package that lets someone say “give me borough-filtered 311 data, cluster fine-grained complaint topics, detect topic spikes by geography, and export a report” [nyc-311-analytics README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajatrayaraddi/nyc-311-analytics/main/README.md) [smart-311 README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hersh-gupta/smart-311/main/README.md).

The right differentiation line for `nyc311` is:
- not “another NYC 311 notebook”
- but “a reproducible complaint-intelligence toolkit with CLI + package + reportable outputs” [nyc-311-analytics README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajatrayaraddi/nyc-311-analytics/main/README.md)

## Bottom Line

My read is:

- `nyc-mesh`: **strongest greenfield gap** [cjio README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityjson/cjio/develop/README.rst) [CityTiler README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jeremy-Gaillard/CityTiler/master/README.md)
- `nyc311`: **also a strong gap**, especially if you package it like a real library instead of a notebook dump [smart-311 README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hersh-gupta/smart-311/main/README.md) [nyc-311-analytics README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajatrayaraddi/nyc-311-analytics/main/README.md)
- `subway-access`: **real but more adjacent-to-existing-civic-work**, so you should emphasize reliability scoring, equity framing, and a cleaner reusable API than prior repos offered [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md) [MTA elevator/accessibility developer docs](https://mta.info/developers/display-elevators-NYCT)

If you want the safest anti-duplication positioning, I’d frame them like this:

- `nyc-mesh`: “NYC open 3D geodata to web-ready meshes and analysis exports”
- `subway-access`: “reliability-aware accessibility analysis, not just ADA labels”
- `nyc311`: “complaint intelligence package, not a one-off notebook”

That is different enough from the existing landscape that I would not worry you’re just rebuilding a famous incumbent repo [cjio README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cityjson/cjio/develop/README.rst) [tsdataclinic/mta README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tsdataclinic/mta/master/README.md) [nyc-311-analytics README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajatrayaraddi/nyc-311-analytics/main/README.md).

If you want, I can next do the more tactical version of this: for each of the three, I can give you a **“what to ship in v0.1 so it is clearly not redundant”** checklist.
